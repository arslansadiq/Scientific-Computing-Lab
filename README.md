# Scientific-Computing-Lab
TUM Praktikum Scientific Computing
The lab course gives an application oriented introduction to the following topics: 
- explicit and implicit time stepping methods for ordinary differential equations 
- numerical methods for stationary and instationary partial differential equations 
- solvers for large, sparse systems of linear equations 
- adaptivity and adaptively refined discretisation grids 
- applications from fluid dynamics and heat transfer
